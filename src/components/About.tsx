          <h2>About me</h2>
          
          <p>My background in translation involves both languages and problem-solving, and these two skills are what sparked my interest in programming back in 2018. I was instantly hooked! I am fascinated by algorithms and absolutely love creating software for people to interact with.</p>
          <p>After creating a few of my own apps and getting involved in some brilliant opportunities as a developer with <a style={{ color: '#1010ff' }} target="_blank" href="https://momentone.io/">Moment One</a> and <a style={{ color: '#1010ff' }} target="_blank" href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/tokyo">Women Who Code Tokyo</a>, I knew I&apos;d found my place. I joined General Assembly&apos;s Software Engineering Immersive to advance my skills to a professional level and ensure I will add value in the workplace.</p>
          <p>My curiosity, patience, and determination have proven key in my success and an asset in the workplace. I am very excited to bring these qualities to the field of Software Engineering, and I look forward to joining a team that values mentorship, celebrates wins, and is excited about their work.</p>
